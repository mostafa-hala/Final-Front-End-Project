                    <P class="note">
                        <span> COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span>
                        <br>
                        It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                        China.
                        </br>
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                        breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                        respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                        mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                        with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                                    People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are
                                    living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried
                                    about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards
                                    Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                                    Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a
                                    nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a
                                    need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors
                                    and myths.

                                    Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead
                                    of the disease that is causing the problem.

                                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                    others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                    between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                                    COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                                    Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals
                                    and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19
                                    is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.

                                    This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first
                                    infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                                    person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on
                                    a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses
                                    are less so.

                                    The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the
                                    community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread
                                    means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are
                                    not sure how or where they became infected.

                                    The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is
                                    actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC
                                    recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                                    (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of
                                    infecting others.

                                    How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release
                                    someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors,
                                    infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves
                                    considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs
                                    and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.

                                    Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on
                                    a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:

                                    The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.

                                    The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.

                                    The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens
                                    collected at least 24 hours apart.

                                    Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of
                                    infection to others.

                                    months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses

                                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                    respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                    COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                    always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                                    Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                    going to the bathroom.

                                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                    that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                                    eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                    is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped
                                    over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                    <h4>Protection measures for everyone</h4>
                                    Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO
                                    website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries
                                    around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks.
                                    Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping
                                    their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the
                                    latest news.

                                    You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some
                                    simple precautions:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or
                                            wash them with soap and water.</li>
                                        <li>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub
                                            kills viruses that may be on your hands.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who
                                            is coughing or sneezing.</li>
                                        <li>Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from
                                            their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
                                            breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing
                                            has the disease.</li>
                                        <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
                                        <li>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,
                                            hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the
                                            virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li>
                                        <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
                                            This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when
                                            you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you
                                            protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
                                            breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions
                                            of your local health authority.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                                            information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow
                                            your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
                                            facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and
                                            other infections.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where
                                            COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places –
                                            especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung
                                            disease.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

                                    Household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting may
                                    have close contact2 with a person with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or
                                    a person under investigation. Close contacts should monitor their health; they
                                    should call their healthcare provider right away if they develop symptoms suggestive
                                    of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath)
                                    <br>
                                    Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their
                                            healthcare provider’s instructions for medication(s) and care. You should
                                            help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support for
                                            getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.</li>
                                        <li>Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his
                                            or her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has
                                            laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s
                                            office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from
                                            getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state
                                            health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical
                                            emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the

                                        <li>Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the
                                            patient as much as possible. Household members should use a separate bedroom
                                            and bathroom, if available.</li>
                                        <li>Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home</li>
                                        <li>Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets
                                            or other animals while sick. For more information, see <a

                                        <li>Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an
                                            air conditioner or an opened window, weather permitting.</li>
                                        <li>Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water
                                            for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains
                                            60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them
                                            together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially
                                            if hands are visibly dirty.
                                        </li>

                                        <li>The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the
                                            patient is not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes
                                            trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should wear a mask when you are
                                            in the same room as the patient.</li>
                                        <li>Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with
                                            the patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal
                                            mucus, vomit, urine. <br>
                                        <li>Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of
                                            gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or
                                            alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of facemask, and
                                            immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand
                                            sanitizer.</li>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes,
                                            drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items.
                                            After the patient uses these items, you should wash them thoroughly (see
                                            below “Wash laundry thoroughly”).</li>
                                        <li>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs,
                                            bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables,
                                            every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body
                                            fluids on them.
                                        <li>Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions.
                                            Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning
                                            product including precautions you should take when applying the product,
                                            such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use
                                            of the product.</li>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Wash laundry thoroughly.
                                        <li>Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or
                                            body fluids on them.</li>
                                        <li>Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items
                                            away from your body. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an
                                            alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after removing your gloves.</li>
                                        <li>Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and
                                            detergent. In general, using a normal laundry detergent according to washing
                                            machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures
                                            recommended on the clothing label.</li>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in
                                            a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean
                                            your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer)
                                            immediately after handling these items. Soap and water should be used
                                            preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
                                        <li>Discuss any additional questions with your state or local health department
                                            or healthcare provider. Check available hours when contacting your local

                                    The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                                    frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and
                                    maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or
                                    sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more

                                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
                                    patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
                                    diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become

                                    80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                                    every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty
                                    breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood
                                    pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                                    People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                        This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does
                                        not
                                        seem
                                        to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is
                                        happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19

                                        impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of
                                        school
                                        dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report

                                        dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare
                                        arrangements, if needed.

                                        school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can

                                        Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                        respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                        COVID-19
                                        associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always
                                        wash
                                        your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                                        Throughout
                                        the
                                        day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to

                                        It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
                                        object
                                        that
                                        has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                                        eyes,
                                        but
                                        this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                        Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever
                                        (i.e.
                                        have
                                        a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new
                                        coronavirus.

                                    <p>
                                        However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with
                                        fever.
                                        This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected
                                        become
                                        sick and develop a fever.

                                        No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus
                                        influenza
                                        type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

                                    <p>
                                        The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are
                                        trying
                                        to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.

                                    <p>
                                        Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against
                                        respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
